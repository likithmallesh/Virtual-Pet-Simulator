# Virtual Pet Simulator

## Description

The Virtual Pet Simulator is an interactive web application that allows users to take care of a virtual pet. Users can feed, play with, and put the pet to sleep, which affects its attributes such as hunger, happiness, and energy. The pet's state is visually represented through different images based on its current attributes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Virtual Pet with Attributes**: The pet has three attributes: hunger, happiness, and energy.
- **Real-time Attribute Updates**: Attributes are displayed using progress bars and updated in real-time.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Buttons to feed, play, and put the pet to sleep, which temporarily change the pet's image to reflect the action being taken.
- **Automatic Attribute Decrease**: The pet's attributes decrease over time, encouraging regular interaction.

## How to Use


1. **Open `index.html`** in a web browser.
2. **Interact with the pet**:
   - **Feed**: Increases the pet's hunger attribute.
   - **Play**: Increases the pet's happiness but decreases energy.
   - **Sleep**: Increases the pet's energy.
3. **Monitor the pet's attributes** using the progress bars.
4. **Watch the pet's image** change based on its current state.

## File Overview

### `index.html`

The HTML file structures the layout of the virtual pet simulator, including the pet image, attribute progress bars, and interactive buttons.

### `styles.css`

The CSS file styles the web application, including the layout, progress bars, and buttons.

### `script.js`

The JavaScript file contains the logic for updating the pet's attributes, changing the pet's image based on its state, and handling user interactions.

## Additional Notes

- The pet's attributes decrease over time, so make sure to interact with it regularly to keep it happy and healthy.
